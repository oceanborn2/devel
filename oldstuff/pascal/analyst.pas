The system analyst job and its evolutions

The computer science offers many kind of jobs for people who want to practise
a  job  which  is oriented  toward the future. All the  more so  as  all the
qualifications levels are concerned because computer specialised work force
is needed at all the level of the society because the computers can do almost
everything when the task involves huge quantities of data and when fast
computation speed is needed. Then, a lot of people can improve their working
conditions with a computer or practise a data processing job without having
the same qualification levels and the same interest in computer science.

Among the main computers-based jobs, the system analyst job is the one that
i would like to practise after my studies because of several reasons :

- the first reason is that those who practise this job must be fond of data
processing techniques because creating a software demands to know all the ways
to make efficient softwares by using fast algorithms and by taking a benefit
of the special abilities of each computer. So, a system analyst must know the
 general  methods to  create  softwares  but  must  also  know  about  the  new
optimisation techniques in order to improve its software's efficiency. Then the
system analyst will give advices to the programmer in order to improve the
liability and the convenience of its programmes.

- the second aspect of this job is that you can make several releases of a
sofware because we cannot consider that a software is finished because it
always exist several possibilities of improvements even if the software is
very good. That's why this job demands to be very original and creative.
You cannot do the same things all the time unless you will lose the customer's
interest and you won't be able to follow the progress of the computer science.

- the last aspect of the system analyst job is that he has to listen to his
customers. At first, the customers explains to him the goal of the software
he would like to have. So, we see that the system analyst must know computer
science but also has to learn about the job of the customer because system
analyst can work in all the kind of jobs. The two common points between all
the system analysts   are that they use data processing techniques and that
they have to  understand the problem that their customers want to solve by
using computers.  Obviously the system analyst spend at least the same time
listening to his customers than thinking of the methods to solve the problem.
So, this aspect of this job allows the system analyst to have relations with
other persons instead  of facing the problem  alone. And  that make this job
much more interesting that the one of system programmer for example because he
can encounter people who don't practise the same job as him and then he can
discover others kind of jobs.

So, in a conclusion, we can say that this job make you use computer science
techniques but can also allow you to have relations with your customers and
with your work team instead of beeing alone. The advantages are that you can
know what the customer think of your work, you can also have advices from him
and from your colleagues because creating an important software today is a
project that involves a lot of people and not only one and the success of
the software depends on the customer's opinion and not only on the your's.

The last thing that we can say is that this job can be a good way to become
a manager because by practising this job you can lead more and more important
projects and finally have an important influence on the board of directors,
and this task can be considered as the job of manager.
